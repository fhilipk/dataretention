					Data Retention is surveillance
				</h2>
				<h3>
					The prevalence of state based surveillance is a concern for all citizens.
				</h3>
				<p class="first-paragraph">
					A corner stone of a democracy is trust in the insitution of government. It is the people who watch the government not the other way around. With the rise universal state based surveillance come the very real potential of abuse from malicious parties from within the insituation of the government to arise. There is no fear whilst the best interest of the public are understood and respected but there is the very a real sense that the foundations of totalitarian insituation are hibernating.

				What is Communication Meta Data?
			</h2>
			<p class="first-paragraph">
				Meta data is the information about the communication (data). It could be said it's the data about the data. A useful metaphor would be a glass of water. The 'content' of the glass is the water; this would be your written or spoken communication. The meta data about the glass could be the temperature, location, holder, chemical composition, etc.; information about the glass and its content.
			</p>
			<p>
				The legislation specifies some of the communications meta data that is required to be recorded, stored and made accessible to government agencies. This includes, but is not limited to:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Identifying information:</strong> name, aliases, address, account number, telephone number, IP Address, age of the caller and receiver.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Non-identifying information:</strong> location communication initiated and terminated, length of call, date and time of call.
			</p>

				A brief history of telecommunication surveillance
			</h2>
			<p class="first-paragraph">
				When billing was done on a timed call-by-call basis the meta data was collected in order to assign costs of usage. However, changes in consumer behavior and business practices over recent years have meant that customers have moved away from per use and moved to subscription based payments. The need for telecommunications providers to collect and store meta data information was reduced to the point that much of it is no longer collected or necessary. It was this information that law enforcement relied on to help investigate crimes.
			</p>

			<h2 id="law">
				What is the new law?
			</h2>
			<p class="first-paragraph">
				The ‘Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015’ passed parliament in March 2015 and came into force on 13 October 2015. Both the Liberal government and the Labor opposition voted in favor of the bill. Only the minor parties objected. Essentially it requires telecommunication providers to collect and make available to law enforcement the meta data relating to the communications of all Australians. There is no requirement for judicial over site on the requested information. This has been the practice of the Australian government already, however it is now an act of parliament and a requirement by law.

				What future crimes are you committing?

			<h2>
				Mass surveillance vs warranted surveillance
			</h2>
			<p class="first-paragraph">
				The need for mass surveillance is often justified by the need of catching terrorist, criminals and pedophiles however, these people represent a very very small portion of the population. The result of drag net surveillance is that all citizens are considered suspects. So called 'future crimes', crimes that are currently not crimes but as levels of surveillance increases can easily be changed into crimes can become a real threat to democracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Senator Scott Ludlam proposed an amendment to the bill that would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant in order to obtain telecommunications data. The amendment was opposed by the government and the opposition. The  result is there is no provision for the requirement of warrants for agencies to access the information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good police practice does not need to impinge on citizens privacy. If there is a suspected crime law enforcement has the capacity to investigate and follow the judiciary procedures that ensure the strength of our democracy. As a society we need to respect law and order but not at the cost of personal freedoms and privacy. This is the path to unchecked power and thus the path to ternary.
